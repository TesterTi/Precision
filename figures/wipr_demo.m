function wipr_demo


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Plots figure 8b of the paper but instead of using the integrated
% precision measure uses the weighted integrated precision measure with the 
% skew weights Gaussianly distributed, such that:
%
%  w_function = @(pi')((1 / (pi_m * sqrt(2*pi)) * exp(-(pi' - pi_m)^2/(2 * pi_s^2)));
%
% where pi_m = 0.129 and pi_s = 0.035 (See section 4.1 of the paper). This 
% figure is not present in the paper and is included for demonstration
% purposes.
%
%
% The weighted integrated precision measure is detailed in Section 3.3.2 
% and its use in Section 4.1 of the paper:

%   Unrepresentative Precision'. In Machine Learning 97 (1-2): 5â€”32, 2014.
