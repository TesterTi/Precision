% Calculates the integrated Precision-Recall curve according to the skews 
% lambda1 and lambda2 using the form inferred from the following paper:
%
%   T. Landgrebe, P. Paclik, R. Duin, and A. Bradley, 
%   'Precision-recall operating characteristic (P-ROC) curves in imprecise 
%   environments'. In ICPR, pp. 123-127, 2006.
%
% The detection should be in the format of a N x 1 or 1 x N vector,
% where N is the number of instances. It should contain 0 for a negative 
% detection and > 0 for a positive detection.
%
% The gt should be in the format of a N x 1 or 1 x N vector, containing 0 
% for the negative class and > 0 for the positive class.
%
% 
% Detailed in Section 3.3.1 of the paper:
%
%   T. Lampert and P. Gancarski, 'The Bane of Skew: Uncertain Ranks and 
%   Unrepresentative Precision'. In Machine Learning 97 (1-2): 5â€”32, 2014.
